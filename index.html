			<p class="jus">The ivory-billed woodpecker is the fourth or fifth largest woodpecker in the world. It was previously considered to be extinct but recent evidence provides
			some hope that the species may still cling on in remote areas of Cuba and Arkansas in the U.S. The bill is, as the name suggests, ivory-white in colour whilst
			the feet and legs are grey. These birds are predominantly black with striking white stripes on the side of the neck and large white wing patches. Males are
			distinguished by their prominent red crown. The most commonly recorded call was an alarmed 'kent' or 'hant', which has been described as sounding like a toy
			trumpet or clarinet. Nestlings produce weak 'buzzing' vocalizations.</p>

			<p class="jus">The ivory-billed woodpecker feeds on wood-boring invertebrates, which colonise trees that have recently died. Using its sturdy bill to excavate
			holes and thus reach the grubs inside, an individual woodpecker is capable of producing a 12 centimetre deep hole in soft wood in less than a minute.
			It is thought that pairs of ivory-billed woodpeckers mate for life, occupying large territories. Mating occurs between January and March and the clutch
			of one to four eggs is laid within a nest hole located in a partially dead tree. Both sexes help to incubate the eggs and to care for the developing
			nestlings; young may remain with their parents until the onset of the following winter.</p>

			United States, whilst C. p. bardii was restricted to Cuba. The species was declared extinct in 1996 but two years later hope was renewed that
			the Cuban subspecies survives in the Sierra Maestra Mountains to the southeast of the island, and in 2005 the U.S. subspecies was rediscovered
			in Arkansas, six decades after the last confirmed sighting.</p>

			have swept away the once extensive tracts of pristine forest that were home to this woodpecker. Logging of the mature forests that form its habitat was probably
			the major cause of the disappearance of this species. Although incredible recent discoveries have provided new hope for both the U.S. and Cuban subspecies,
			previously considered extinct, the ivory-billed woodpecker is nevertheless clinging on to an extremely precarious existence.</p>

			<p class="jus">The Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is considered to be one of the most critically endangered big cats in the world, with just
			35 remaining in the wild, all in the Russian Far East. It is one of ten living subspecies of leopard (according to the most recent genetic study) but it is
			especially distinctive due to a particularly pale coat compared to most other subspecies, and dark rosettes which are large and widely spaced with thick,
			unbroken rings. This beautiful leopard is well adapted to living in the harsh, cold climates of its range, with a thick coat that can grow as long as 7 cm in winter.
			Leopards give a distinctive rasping call, rather than a growl, as their main vocalisation.</p>

			in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The local ungulates that make up the majority of this leopard’s prey have also been greatly depleted, leading
			the leopards to concentrate on domestic livestock, including farmed deer, and therefore inciting further persecution. The tiny population that
			survives today is under extreme risk of extinction; genetic variation is low in small populations and they are extremely vulnerable to any chance
			event such as an epidemic or large wild fire. Poaching remains a threat in Russia and annual wild fires rage through the area. In addition a

			but the leopard has been largely overlooked until now. NGOs such as Phoenix, supported by funds from the Tigris Foundation, AMUR and the
			Zoological Society of London (ZSL), carry out anti-poaching patrols, fire-fighting and education programmes as well as providing compensation
			funds for local livestock. Population monitoring and ecological studies are spearheaded by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) working with
			Russian scientists. An area in China's Jilin province has recently been set aside for the creation of a National Park, in order to safeguard
			the remnant population there. Moscow Zoo and the London Zoological Society oversee the captive breeding programme, which provides funds for
			conservation projects and acts as a reservoir of replacement stock for the wild should it be so needed. But there is still a huge amount of work
			to be done to prevent the imminent extinction of the Amur leopard.</p>

			composed of keratin fibres. Adults are grey in colour, and have an armour-plated appearance caused by the deep folds of hairless skin.</p>

			saplings down to access food. Females reach sexual maturity at about five to seven years of age, whereas males become mature later, typically
			at about ten years of age. The rate of reproduction in this species is relatively slow; females give birth to a single young every one to three
			years, after a presumed gestation of 15 to 16 months, as in other rhinos. With the exception of mothers with their offspring and mating pairs,
			the Javan rhinoceros is a largely solitary species.</p>

			<p class="jus">In Indonesia, the Javan rhino has been legally protected since 1931, and Ujung Kulon National Park was set aside for the
			conservation of this species. The protected area in which the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros occurs, (previously known as the Cat Loc Nature Reserve),
			was, for many years, ineffectively protected, but since the Cat Loc area was integrated into the Cat Tien National Park in 1998, more forest guards
			have been deployed, and the conservation organisation WWF has been supporting these teams with better equipment and allowances.</p>
			<p class="jus">In 1998, WWF also launched the Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS), which specifically tackles the issue of habitat loss.</p>
			<p class="jus">A Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for Asian rhinos, published in 1997 by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Asian Rhino
			Specialist Group, suggests that the possibility of moving some of the rhinos into another area should be looked into. This would help lessen the
			chance of disease or a natural disaster affecting all individuals simultaneously. The action plan also suggests that bringing some of the rhinos
			into a managed, breeding sanctuary should be considered.</p>

			this rare species, teetering on the brink of extinction.</p>

			<p class="jus">The name 'sportive' came about owing to this species' interesting habit of adopting a boxer-like stance when threatened. Northern sportive
			lemurs (Lepilemur septentrionalis) are one of the smallest of the Lepilemurs and have pale grey-brown backs with a darker line that runs from the head down
			to the tail. There is some brown around the top of the head and around their shoulders, and their undersides are grey. With both eyes facing forwards they
			have excellent binocular vision. They are arboreal and nocturnal and move from tree to tree by leaping. They adopt a vertical posture, clinging to the tree
			with pads on their hands and feet. They then leap in this upright position.</p>

			<p class="jus">Relatively little is known about the behaviour of these animals. Together with other sportive lemurs, they are believed to be 'caecotrophic',
			meaning they eat their faeces, digesting their food for a second time. The reason for this behaviour is thought to be due to the low energy value of their food 
			- chiefly leaves - which has to be fermented within their gut in order to allow bacteria to break down the cellulose and release the sugars and starches
			within the leaves. Rabbits also employ this process. As no mammal can digest cellulose on its own, it has to rely on bacteria to do this. Many other
			plant-eating mammals have evolved a system to extract as much nutrition as possible from their poor diets. The best-known examples are cows and sheep,
			which regurgitate food for a second chew.</p>
			<p class="jus">Northern sportive lemurs give birth to a single youngster and they live together, with the mother leaving the baby on a branch whilst she feeds. 
			Males are solitary and their territories sometimes overlap those of a number of females. The males will visit each female in the vicinity during the animals' breeding
			season, but if he encounters another male within his territory he will defend it vigorously. They also call to indicate their presence within an area of forest.</p>
			<p class="jus">These animals spend the daylight hours sleeping in holes in trees up to eight metres from the ground, although they have also been recorded as low
			as one metre. They have been reported as falling prey to Sanzinia madagascariensis, one of the three species of native boa, which takes lemurs from their
			sleeping holes.</p>

			<p class="jus">The North Atlantic right whale is currently one of the rarest large whales in the world, having been drastically reduced to critically low
			numbers by years of exploitation. Its robust, somewhat rotund, body is mostly black, with a large head that measures up to one third of the total body length.
			Some individuals may also bear white patches on the underside, while others have a more mottled appearance. More often, the only conspicuous
			feature of this great whale are the irregular patches of thickened tissue, called callosites, on the head. These callosites are inhabited by many
			small amphipods, known as cyamids or whale lice, and form a pattern unique to each individual whale, thus providing a means of identification. The North
			Atlantic right whale lacks a dorsal fin, but has large, paddle-like pectoral fins used for steering, and an enormous tail that provides propulsion with
			powerful vertical strokes. The downward-curved mouth of the North Atlantic right whale contains between 200 and 270 baleen plates on each side of the upper
			jaw. These plates, each measuring around two metres long and fringed with fine hairs, replace teeth in Balaenidae whales, and are central to their method
			of feeding. The North Atlantic right whale has two blowholes situated on top of its head through which it breathes, producing a distinctive, bushy,
			v-shaped cloud of spray when it exhales at the surface.</p>

			<p class="jus">Remarkably for their large size, North Atlantic right whales feed only on tiny planktonic prey, including large copepods, the size of a grain
			of rice; krill, a shrimp-like crustacean; tiny planktonic snails and the drifting larval stages of barnacles and other crustaceans. North Atlantic right
			whales are 'skim feeders', which feed by swimming forward with their mouth open, allowing water to flow into the mouth and out through the baleen. Tiny
			prey is strained from the water as it becomes caught in the fringed baleen, where it is then dislodged by the tongue and swallowed. Although they often
			feed at the ocean surface, or just below, the North Atlantic right whale is also believed to feed close to the bottom, as it has been seen surfacing after
			a 10 to 20 minute dive with mud on its head.</p>
			<p class="jus">After feeding at northern latitudes during the summer, the North Atlantic right whale migrates south for winter. Pregnant females head for
			the inshore calving grounds, whilst the location of the remaining majority of the population is not known. Wherever they head, this is the time at which mating
			takes place. North Atlantic right whale females typically first calve at nine to ten years of age, and then give birth to a single young every three years.
			The gestation period lasts for about one year, and following birth, the mother and her young remain close until the calf is weaned at the age of one. During
			its first year of life the calf learns the location of critical feeding grounds from its mother, which it will continue to visit for the remainder of its life.
			The female then takes a third year to replenish her energy stores before breeding again.</p>
			<p class="jus">Today, the North Atlantic right whale is a rarely seen animal, but its name refers to a time when they were more frequently observed, when they
			swam slowly, close to shore, thus making them an easy target for whalers. Not only did this swimming behaviour make this whale the 'right' one to hunt, but it
			also floated when dead and yielded vast quantities of valuable oil and baleen. Despite its bulky size, the North Atlantic right whale is able to perform acrobatic
			acts such as jumping out of the water, known as breaching, violently slapping the water surface with the tail and slapping the surface with a pectoral fin.
			Although the purpose of these behaviours is not fully understood, they may be used in communication. Similarly, the range of low frequency groans, moans and
			belches that the North Atlantic right whale makes are hypothesized to be used to communicate with other individuals, or signal aggression.</p>

			from Labrador, Greenland, Iceland and Norway south to Florida and north-western Africa. Today, this whale appears to be effectively extinct in the eastern
			North Atlantic, and it survives only in the western North Atlantic, from Florida to Nova Scotia.</p>

			<p class="jus">With, as of 2008, between just 300 and 350 North Atlantic right whales remaining, this species' existence lies in an extremely precarious situation.
			Years of whaling, starting in the 11th century and becoming a modern industrial practice in the early 20th century, have left North Atlantic right whale stocks
			seriously depleted in the western Atlantic, and virtually extinct in the eastern Atlantic. They were killed in their thousands for their valuable oil and baleen,
			until commercial whaling was prohibited by the International Whaling Commission in 1935.</p>
			<p class="jus">Whilst the North Atlantic right whale is no longer hunted, decades of exploitation have left a tragic legacy. The small, remaining population,
			concentrated along the heavily industrialised coast of north-eastern America, is highly vulnerable to the impacts of human activities. Collision with ships is
			currently the most serious source of mortality threatening the North Atlantic right whale, and was the cause of 16 North Atlantic right whale deaths between 1970
			and 1999. This is closely followed by the threat of entanglement in commercial fishing gear, either active gear or nets that have been lost or damaged. Known
			as 'ghost gear', this fishing equipment continues to wreak havoc on marine species, with three North Atlantic right whales known to have died from entanglement
			since 1970 and a further eight known to have been seriously injured, most likely with fatal consequences. These numbers may sound small, but in a population 
			of just 300 or so individuals, the consequences can be enormous.</p>
			<p class="jus">A number of other threats may also be impacting this imperilled species, including a loss of habitat due to human activity, oil spills, man-made
			noise which may interfere with communication, intensive commercial fishing having knock-on effects on prey availability, and global climate change. As the North
			Atlantic right whale has a relatively narrow range of prey on which it can feed, and relies on a specific combination of water currents and temperatures to create
			suitable feeding grounds, changes to ocean temperatures and currents caused by global climate change could have devastating affects. Indeed, climate change may be
			the final factor that pushes this species over the brink to extinction.</p>

			<p class="jus">Since the North Atlantic right whale was protected from hunting in 1935 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), and also protected in
			Canada, which is not a member of the IWC, the most important conservation need for this species is the reduction, or elimination, of deaths and injuries
			from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear.</p>
			<p class="jus">Both the US and Canada have developed recovery plans for this species, with the aim of addressing these issues, and a number of measures have
			already been implemented. These include regulations in the US to restrict the use of certain types of fishing gear in areas and times where North Atlantic right
			whales are common, as well as regulations that specify the distance with which a whale-watching vessel or other ship may approach a whale. Since 1999, a scheme
			has been in place in two areas in calving and summering grounds to warn vessels when there are right whales in the area, and in the Bay of Fundy, shipping lanes
			have been moved to divert them away from the major summer concentrations of right whales. As of yet, there is no data to indicate whether such measures have been
			successful or not, and recovery of this species continues to be slow, or even absent. If these measures have not been sufficient, the outlook for the North Atlantic
			right whale is grim. As it is a long lived species, extinction may not occur in the near future, but the extinction of this great whale in the next century is a
			very real possibility.</p>

			<p class="jus">The astonishing discovery of this unusual, long-horned bovid in 1992 is generally considered to be the greatest animal find of recent times. Not
			only is it the first large mammal to be discovered since the Kouprey (Bos sauveli) in 1936, but it is also so different from any previously known species that
			a separate genus was constructed for it. Both males and females have long, slender horns that are up to 52 centimetres in length, almost straight but with a 
			slight curve backwards, and which are thought to be used for protection against predators and possibly in intraspecific conflict. The short glossy coat ranges
			from a rich chestnut-brown to almost black, generally being paler on the belly than the back, with a thin black line extending down the spine and white patches
			on the side of the neck of some individuals. The tail is split into three bands of colour - brown at the top, cream in the middle, and black towards the end,
			tipped in a fluffy tassel. A cream-coloured band marks the rump, and white bands encircle the lower legs, just above the hooves. The brown face has a striking
			pattern of white spots and slashes, including long, thin stripes above each eye, giving the appearance of eyebrows.</p>

			<p class="jus">Due to the saola's relatively recent discovery and the difficulty of detecting it, little is known about this enigmatic  species'  ecology or life
			history. It has been photographed in the wild on only three occasions, and no biologist has ever reported seeing the animal in the wild. Much of what we know about
			the saola has come from information provided by local people in its range. They report that the species is generally solitary, although there have been a few
			reports that they sometimes travels in small groups, perhaps during the breeding season. Most of the information on reproduction comes from a single pregnant
			female held briefly in captivity in northern Laos (it died after just a few weeks). Calculations made from the size of the female's foetus, together with all
			other data to date, suggest that the saola is a seasonal breeder, mating between late August and mid-November in Laos. If this is the case, births would coincide
			with the onset of the monsoon, somewhere around April, May and June in northern Laos.</p>
			<p class="jus">This single captive is also the source of much of the behavioural information about the saola. It appeared primarily diurnal or crepuscular,
			with activity often concentrated early in the morning and late in the afternoon. The saola browses on, at least, the fleshy herb layer of riverside vegetation.</p>

			<p class="jus">After its relatively recent discovery, the saola is now the focus of attention for another reason - its grave danger of extinction. The
			species has a small range where it is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and, especially, hunting and snaring. Hunters intensively pursue animals valued
			in traditional East Asian 'medicine' and the local bushmeat trades, and although the saola itself apparently has limited value and is not pursued aggressively,
			it is killed incidentally in the pursuit of other species. In the past, hunters have also tried to capture the saola because of the intense interest in this
			new and strange species. Sadly, the more than a dozen saola known to have been captured and held in captivity were all poorly kept, and with the exception of
			two that were quickly released into the wild, all died within days or weeks or, at most, five months of their capture. None are in captivity anywhere in the
			world today. As of November 2010, the most recent confirmed record of the species was an adult male captured by villagers in northern Laos in August 2010,
			and held by them for several days before it, too, died.</p>
			<p class="jus">Habitat destruction poses another threat, with forests being lost and fragmented by infrastructure development (such as roads and dams), agricultural
			encroachment and mineral mining. In Laos, the threat of hunting is exacerbated by the creation of logging roads, which fragment the remaining forest patches and
			make wildlife more accessible to hunters. In particular, Vietnam's new Ho Chi Minh Road down the length of the Annamites is cause for deep concern, since it slices
			through the length of the species' range in Vietnam and has feeder roads branching into Laos.</p>

			<p class="jus">The saola is found in a number of protected areas in which conservation initiatives have been implemented. In Vietnam, in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve,
			where the saola was first discovered, the Ministry of Forestry has cancelled its logging operations, and surveys and other conservation activities have also been
			conducted in the Pu Huong Nature Reserve, in cooperation with Vietnam's Vinh University. Furthermore, within the Pu Mat National Park, many surveys on the distribution
			and ecology of the saola were carried out between 1998 and 2003, as part of the Social Forestry and Nature Conservation project. The Ministry of Forestry in Vietnam
			has also issued a ban on further capture, trade, or holding of this rare animal, given its apparent inability to survive captivity.</p>
			<p class="jus">In Laos, the Nam Theun 2 dam project provides US $1 million per year for 30 years for protection of the Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected
			Area (NNT NPA), the largest protected area with the saola in Laos or Vietnam. The Wildlife Conservation Society is working with provincial government partners
			and industry to protect the saola in key areas north and south of NNT NPA, which are not in national protected areas.</p>
			<p class="jus">In 2006, the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group established a Saola Working Group, to bring more focused attention
			to saola conservation. The WWF Greater Mekong Programme has also been actively involved in the conservation of the saola in Vietnam, setting up initiatives
			like the Vu Quang Project, which endeavoured to improve the conservation management and support the livelihoods of local people in the area where the saola
			was discovered. WWF has also been active in helping provincial authorities establish three new adjoining protected areas for the saola in the southern part
			of its range. The first two of these areas were established in 2010.  In collaboration with WWF and provincial governments, the Darwin Initiative is, until
			2012, supporting research on patterns of hunting and their impacts on saola in the same landscape. In addition, in 2003, WWF produced a documentary showing 
			the plight of the saola, which was shown on Vietnamese television, and a research programme on the saola, undertaken by WWF, is ongoing.</p>
			<p class="jus">Despite these conservation efforts, however, the future of this enigmatic and beautiful bovid remains uncertain, and an ongoing push to save it
			now ensues.  There are few wildlife species in the world, if any, that share saola's combination of biological distinctiveness, degree of endangerment, and modest
			level of conservation attention. We are now at a point in history where a small window remains to save this remarkable animal .</p>

			<p class="jus">The leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is the world's largest turtle; the largest recorded individual weighed a massive 916 kilograms. This
			turtle earned its common name because it lacks the typical bony plates on its carapace. Instead, its shell is flexible and covered in a thin layer of leathery skin.
			The leatherback turtle is dark in colour, with white and pink spots. Females also have a characteristic 'pink spot' on the top of their heads.</p>
			<p class="jus">In addition to its huge size, the leatherback turtle can be easily identified by the seven narrow ridges running the length of the carapace, and 
			by its particularly large front flippers.</p>

			<p class="jus">Adult leatherback turtles feed mainly on jellyfish and other soft-bodied species. They are exceptional amongst reptiles because they are partly
			able to maintain an elevated body temperature via thermal inertia and a specially organised blood supply system in their shoulders. These features allow leatherback
			turtles to travel to cold waters and to dive to depths greater than 1,000 metres in search of prey.</p>
			<p class="jus">To nest, female leatherback turtles emerge at night on beaches to lay their eggs. Using their rear flippers they excavate deep, 'boot-shaped' nests into
			which roughly 100 eggs are laid. Around 20 percent of the eggs in each nest are small and yolkless. Mature female leatherback turtles return to the same beach to nest
			every few years, but within one season a female can lay four to ten clutches. The sex of the hatchlings is influenced by incubation temperatures: hotter nests produce
			all females and cooler nests produce all males.</p>

		<div role="main" data-theme="a" data-form="ui-body-a" class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
			<p class="jus">Perhaps the greatest threat to the leatherback turtle is global climate change. This is expected to affect this species through habitat loss, physiological
			changes and loss of prey.</p>
			<p class="jus">Average global temperatures are predicted to increase by at least 2 degrees Celsius in the next 40 years due to climate change. An increase in the
			temperature of the sand used for nesting could have serious consequences for the leatherback turtle, as gender of the hatchlings is determined by incubation
			temperature. The outcome of this is likely to be an increase in the number of females relative to males in populations. This could threaten the stability of
			leatherback turtle populations in the future. In addition, increases in temperature have also been shown to lead to hatchling abnormalities and other developmental
			problems in young leatherback turtles.</p>
			<p class="jus">Ocean levels are thought to have risen at an average rate of 1.8 millimetres per year since 1961. Ocean levels are predicted to rise even more rapidly
			in the future, while increases in storm frequency and severity are also expected. This is likely to lead to increased beach erosion and degradation, which could wash
			away leatherback turtle nests and decrease nesting habitat.</p>
			<p class="jus">Changes in ocean currents are also expected due to climate change. This may affect juvenile leatherbacks in their migrations following hatching, as well
			as adults' navigation. In addition, changes to ocean currents are likely to affect the abundance and distribution of jellyfish and other leatherback turtle prey
			species.</p>
			<p class="jus">The leatherback turtle's ability to adapt to climate change is severely compromised by the rate of the change. Such rapid changes, in combination with
			the leatherback turtle's long and slow maturing life history, may limit the species' capacity to adapt quickly enough to prevent severe population impacts.</p>
			<p class="jus">Numerous other threats are also compromising the leatherback turtle's ability to adapt to climate change. Several populations of leatherback turtles
			in the Pacific have plummeted in recent years, principally due to accidental capture in fisheries and the over-harvest of eggs. Other threats to the leatherback
			turtle worldwide include habitat loss, boat strikes, and ingestion of discarded plastics, which the turtles mistake for jellyfish.</p>

			<p class="jus">The leatherback turtle is protected throughout most of its range, and international trade in the leatherback turtle and products is banned under
			Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Many conservation projects have been set up on leatherback turtle nesting beaches,
			with specific management protocols tailored to each location. The attachment of Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) to shrimp nets can help prevent the accidental
			capture of turtles (by-catch) and the US government has recently set up Leatherback Conservation Areas in the north Pacific that are off-limits to long-line
			fisheries during certain times of the year.</p>
			<p class="jus">Despite encouraging signs of stable or increasing leatherback turtle populations in the Atlantic, conservationists are concerned that extinction
			of other populations is only a matter of time. Recent estimates have suggested there are no more than 2,000 breeding females in the eastern Pacific, making this
			population extremely vulnerable.</p>

			<p class="jus">Also known as the Amur tiger, the Siberian tiger resides in a small region in the southeast region Russia. They are also located in small numbers
			in China and North Korea.</p>
			<p class="jus">Siberian tigers are solitary animals, marking their scent on trees to keep other tigers away. They roam many miles and hunt often. They stalk their
			prey, which include elk, boar, bears, and deer, until they are close enough to pounce. When successful, they drag their kill to a secluded area before devouring the
			meat.Tigers also hunt smaller animals like rabbits, pikas, and fish.</p>

			<p class="jus">There are only 400-500 Siberian tigers left in the world, and they are considered endangered by IUCN's Red List. One cause of their dwindling
			population is loss of habitat due to deforestation. In addition, Siberian tigers are poached, or illegally hunted, for their fur and for body parts that are used
			for traditional medicines.</p>
			<p class="jus">Human activities are the principal cause of declining tiger numbers. Hunting was a major cause of mortality in the past, both for trophies and as
			part of organised pest control measures. Poaching and illegal killing, for example by livestock owners, remains one of today's major threats to the survival of
			this species, particularly with the growing demand for tiger bones in Oriental 'medicine'.</p>
			<p class="jus">The demand for remedies made from tiger parts has grown due to increasing affluence in Asia, and laws preventing international trade in tiger parts
			are largely ignored. Hong Kong is the main importer of tiger products, with tiger bone the most used part. The bones are crushed to be used in anti-inflammatory drugs
			for rheumatism and arthritis, among many other uses. The trade in tiger skins is also increasing.</p>
			<p class="jus">Habitat loss has occurred throughout much of the tiger's range and is now severely threatening its survival; as land becomes rapidly developed to meet
			the increasing demands of the Asian population, tiger populations become isolated in remaining fragments of wilderness and ultimately die out. The tiger's natural
			prey species have declined in numbers due to over-hunting, which has led tiger's in some areas to turn to domestic livestock as a source of food, inevitably causing
			conflict with local farmers.</p>

			<p class="jus">During 2010, the tiger was the focus of substantial conservation effort and investment, culminating in an unprecedented pledge by the 13 tiger

			<p class="jus">The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) is the largest salamander in the world, and is fully aquatic, with many adaptations for this lifestyle.
			It grows up to 1.8 metres in length, though most individuals found today are considerably smaller. The skin is dark brown, black or greenish in colour and irregularly
			blotched. It is also rough, wrinkled and porous which facilitates respiration through the skin as this large amphibian lacks gills. The Chinese giant salamander 
			has an elongated body, and two pairs of legs which are roughly similar in size. The snout is less rounded than that of the related Japanese giant salamander and the 
			tail is a little longer and broader. Both species have tubercles on the head and throat, though their arrangement is different. The Chinese species has small, paired
			tubercles arranged in rows parallel with the lower jaw, while the Japanese species' tubercles are mostly single and irregularly scattered. The eyes are tiny, with
			no eyelids, and positioned on top of the broad, flat head, providing the salamander with poor vision.</p>

			<p class="jus">The Chinese giant salamander is generally active at night, when it relies on smell and touch to locate its prey. This huge amphibian lives in muddy,
			dark rock crevices along riverbanks and feeds on fish, smaller salamanders, worms, insects, crayfish and snails, catching them with a rapid sideways snap of the mouth.</p>
			<p class="jus">Like other amphibians, this salamander has smooth skin that lacks scales. The moist skin acts as a respiratory surface, where oxygen enters the body 
			and carbon dioxide is released.</p>
			<p class="jus">Mating behaviour has been described for the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and is probably similar for the Chinese giant salamander. 
			Reproduction appears to take place from late August to September, when hundreds of individuals congregate at nest sites. Males occupy breeding cavities which are
			aggressively guarded against intruders. Males compete viciously, with many dying from injuries. Females enter the cavities, lay between 400 and 500 eggs that are
			held together like a string of beads and then leave immediately. The male fertilises the eggs, and protects them from predators such as fish, until they hatch 
			12 to 15 weeks later in the early spring. The larvae are only three centimetres long and resemble adults in shape. As larvae they do have gills, and though they 
			lose them quite early in life, they never fully lose all larval characteristics. Both the Chinese and Japanese giant salamanders are long lived, with one specimen
			in captivity living for 52 years.</p>

			species, but DNA evidence has led to the recognition of the eastern and western populations as distinct species; Gorilla beringei and Gorilla gorilla respectively.
			Gorillas have robust bodies with broad chests and long arms. The mountain gorilla subspecies (Gorilla beringei beringei) has a particularly long coat, which is 
			blue-black to brownish-grey in colour. Mature male gorillas are much larger than females with a large skull crest. At about 14 years old, the hair in the saddle

			than their western relatives, exceptionally numbering more than 50 individuals. There is no distinct breeding season and females give birth only once
			every three to four years due to the gestation period of 8.5 months and a long period of parental care. Newborn gorillas have greyish-pink skin and can crawl
			after nine weeks; they are not fully weaned until 3.5 years. Males defend their females and offspring using their large size in intimidating displays involving
			charging and chest-beating.</p>

			usually on the ground.</p>

			<p class="jus">The best known of the eastern gorillas, the mountain gorilla, is found in two isolated populations. One is in the Virunga Volcanoes region,
			situated on the borders of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The other occurs in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in south-western Uganda.
			The Virunga population was estimated to comprise 380 individuals in 2003, while there were estimated to be just 300 individuals in the Bwindi population in 2006. The 
			eastern lowland or Grauer's gorilla (G. b. graueri) is found only in eastern DRC, and is significantly more abundant than the mountain gorilla.</p>

			<p class="jus">Snares set to trap other wildlife may accidentally maim and even kill gorillas, while poaching for infants has re-emerged as a threat to mountain
			gorillas. The biggest threats to Grauer's gorillas result from armed conflict in and around the parks. In the past decade, many Grauer's gorillas have been shot 
			dead in crossfire, or for food by people hiding in the forest. Ongoing instability in the region means that this problem is getting worse, as civil war has made 
			arms more accessible and continues to create large numbers of refugees. A relatively new threat to the gorillas comes from the tourism. While tourism has so far
			aided its survival, large numbers of people coming into close contact with gorillas may put them at risk from human diseases.</p>

			<p class="jus">The mountain gorilla occurs mainly within national parks and in some areas is protected by armed guards to prevent poaching. Gorillas in
			the Virunga region have been studied and protected for many decades and are now seen as an important source of tourist revenue. The United Nations Environmental
			Programme (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP). This project is aimed 
			at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved.
			A multifaceted approach is needed to ensure the survival of one of our most impressive cousins.</p>
